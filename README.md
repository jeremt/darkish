# Darkish

Simple extension to add dark mode to specific websites with custom css.

_⚠️ This is a very simple version I made to see how extensions work, there might be some bugs 😅_

## Feel free to contribute 🤗

You can improve the code of the extension itself, the existing css files in `styles/` or create a new one.

**For new files, you also need to add it to `websites` in `background.js`.**

## TODO

-   [ ] detect current mode an provide css only if the mode matches
-   [ ] fix lemonde css
-   [ ] add popup for feedback and contribution
-   [ ] handle default fallback + corresponding setting
-   [ ] add landing page
-   [ ] publish extension
